Hi, my name is David Kim. I'm an undergraduate senior in ECE & CS, planning to
pursue a Ph.D. in robotics and machine learning and I am super stoked about this
class!! ^\_^

In my free time, I like to try to improve my cooking, jazz improv piano, and
League of Legends skills. You can find out more about me on my [personal
website](http://heydavid.kim).
